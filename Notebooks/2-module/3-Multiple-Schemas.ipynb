    "## Review\n",
    "We just covered state schema and reducers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, all graph nodes communicate with a single schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this single schema contains the graph's input and output keys / channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals for this session\n",
    "There are cases where we may want a bit more control over this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Internal nodes may pass information that is not required in the graph's input / output.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may also want to use different input / output schemas for the graph. The output might, for example, only contain a single relevant output key.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll discuss a few ways to customize graphs with multiple schemas."
