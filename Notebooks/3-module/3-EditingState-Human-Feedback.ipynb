    "1. **Approval** - We can interrupt our agent, surface state to a user, and allow the user to accept an action\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Debugging** - We can rewind the graph to reproduce or avoid issues\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Editing** - You can modify the state\n",

    "We showed how breakpoints support user approval, but don't yet know how to modify our graph state once our graph is interrupted!\n",

    "Now, let's show how to directly edit the graph state and insert human feedback."
