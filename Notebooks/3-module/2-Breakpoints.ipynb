    "1. **Approval** - We can interrupt our agent, surface state to a user, and allow the user to accept an action\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Debugging** - We can rewind the graph to reproduce or avoid issues\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Editing** - You can modify the state\n",

    "LangGraph offers several ways to get or update agent state to support various **human-in-the-loop** workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll introduce **breakpoints**, which provide a simple way to stop the graph at specific steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll show how this enables **user approval**."
