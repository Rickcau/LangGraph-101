    "The messages array is at the core of all Chat Completion APIs so it's very important that you undestand this.  When you leverage framrworks that interact with LLMs, often times they provide some sort of abstraction or wrapper for the raw structure.  [Here is a link](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests) to the OpenAI API reference documentation.  I highly recommend you first get familiar with how to call these endpoints by simply using CURL.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of calling an OpenAI endpoint and what is important here is the messages array structure.  All these frameworks will end up pass the messages array in this format regardless of how they abstracte the messages array, which is very important.  When you are leveraging the Messages object in LangChain or LangGraph how you interact with it may be a little different but in the end your messages arrive at the endpoint in the format below.\n",

      "Here are the detailed analyses for each of the specified contract clauses:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Confidentiality Clause**:\n",
      "   - **Scope**: The clause specifies that all information shared during the project is to be kept confidential. This broad scope suggests that any data, documents, or communications exchanged are protected.\n",
      "   - **Duration**: The confidentiality obligation extends for 5 years. This is a relatively standard duration, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected beyond the project's conclusion.\n",
      "   - **Obligations**: Parties involved must take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of the information. This includes not disclosing it to unauthorized third parties and ensuring that any employees or agents who have access to the information are also bound by confidentiality obligations.\n",
      "   - **Potential Risks**: There is a risk of inadvertent disclosure or breach by parties who may not fully understand the extent of the confidentiality obligations. Additionally, the clause does not specify any penalties for breaches, which could complicate enforcement.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Termination Clause**:\n",
      "   - **Notice Period**: The clause allows either party to terminate the agreement with a 30-day notice. This provides a reasonable period for the other party to adjust to the termination and make necessary arrangements.\n",
      "   - **Grounds for Termination**: The clause is quite flexible, as it does not require specific grounds for termination. This can be advantageous if a party needs to exit the contract for unforeseen reasons but also introduces uncertainty, as termination can occur without cause.\n",
      "   - **Post-termination Obligations**: The clause does not address what happens post-termination, such as the handling of ongoing obligations or the return of confidential information, which could lead to disputes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Liability Clause**:\n",
      "   - **Limitation Scope**: Liability is capped at the total contract value, which limits the financial exposure of each party. This is a common practice to prevent disproportionate liability.\n",
      "   - **Cap Amount**: The cap is directly tied to the contract value, ensuring that the maximum potential loss is predictable and manageable.\n",
      "   - **Exclusions**: The clause does not specify any exclusions or carve-outs (e.g., for gross negligence or willful misconduct), which could be a point of contention if a serious breach occurs.\n",
      "   - **Potential Risks**: While the cap protects parties from excessive liability, it might not cover all potential damages, especially in cases of significant loss or damage. It's important to ensure that the cap is sufficient relative to the potential risks involved in the project.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each clause serves to protect the parties involved, but it's crucial to ensure that all terms are clearly defined and understood to minimize legal risks and disputes.\n"
